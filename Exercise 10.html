    <h2 id="CH1">CHICKEN</h2>
    <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
      Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking,
      grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending 
      on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken 
      has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more 
      healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.</p>

    <h2 id="DRAW1">DRAWING</h2>
    <p>Drawing is essentially a technique in which images are depicted on a surface by 
      making lines, though drawings can also contain tonal areas, washes and other 
      non-linear marks</p>

      where the first to discover the art. Since this time artist have been able to manipulate 
      line and colour using not only pencil or graphite, but using charcoal, ink, water colour 
      pencils  and micro pens, creating a mixed media artwork classified as contemporary drawing art. </p>
